# elv
A very basic Lisp with Erlang-style processes, on a virtual machine.

I wrote this many years ago, descended from
[https://github.com/darius/ichbins](Ichbins), but judged it a dead
end. It's archived here for your entertainment: a tiny system
combining some aspects of Lisp and Erlang but depending on nothing
more than C. (Well, plus the assembler in Python.)

Undocumented, but these lines should build and run it:

    $ make
    $ (cd tests; ./testallmeta)

The tests serve also as basic examples.

Although now the compiler is compiled by itself, when developing this
system I didn't depend on this ability to bootstrap; instead there was
a version of the compiler that ichbins could compile
(`older/elvc.scm`) along with a parallel version (`selvc.scm`) that
could take advantage of the extra features of itself and the
VM. `ichbins.scm` itself and its bootstrapping process were also
included in this repo. So were the corresponding variants of the test
scripts. I've cut all that out as clutter (except for keeping an
archive copy of `elvc.scm` in `older/` so that the removed stuff can be
reconstructed without undue effort). If you want to actively develop
this system, as a weird challenge or learning experience or something,
then it might be easiest to bring back the non-bootstrapped version of
the compiler, just so then you can use gdb on its C-compiled output --
as the VM has no debugger. OTOH you might rather make debugging nicer
on the VM! Whatevs.

(`older/` retains a few other files useful when compiling via ichbins
instead of bootstrapping. Move them back to their proper places then.)
